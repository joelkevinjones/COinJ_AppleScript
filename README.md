# COinJ_AppleScript
Mimic the linking capability between mail, events, notes, etc. that Claris Organizer/Palm Desktop had using AppleScript.

This repo is a spin off of the "snippets" repo used for generating a modern Claris Organizer (CO)/Palm Desktop (PD).
Here are scripts to emulate the inter-linking abilities of PD by using Mac OS application URLs and AppleScript.
This an interim solution to get some of the capablities until a complete replacement application is created.
These scripts put URLS into the pasteboard/copy buffer URLs for accessing data in Calendar
Contacts, Evernote, Finder, Safari, Mail, etc.
